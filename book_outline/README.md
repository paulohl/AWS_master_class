Book Title – [Mastering AWS]
Understand AWS Cloud and its comprehensive offerings catalogue:  from infrastructure to serverless applications.
Subtitle - [Cloud adoption using the AWS Cloud computing ecosystem]
AWS provides Cloud-based tools (offerings, products) enabling businesses in all segments and sizes to seamlessly migrate or build their business IT operations in the Cloud. An exploratory journey throughout the AWS Cloud Computing ecosystem to understand the fundaments for Cloud adoption alternatives.
Tagline - [Explore AWS Cloud ecosystem]
This book will help you in understanding the AWS Cloud and how to leverage its services and components to build your Cloud-based environment.
Who is this book for- [Students and Professionals]
This book was written for the technical Cloud computing aficionado. Systems Engineers, Solutions Engineers, Solution Architects, Systems Architects, Software Engineers, and related professionals in the Information Technology industry, and for students of the same industry, whose target career is planned to include Cloud computing knowledge.

Book Description 
AWS is one of the major global Cloud Services Providers, competing directly with Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle, and with large providers of specialized Cloud services. When building a Cloud-based environment to replace former on-premises operations, there is a wide variety of component services and models to choose from development framework, application platform, data services, middleware, web services, and infrastructure, among many others. AWS provides the full stack to enable businesses to adopt the Cloud, including different components with the same purpose, while depending on connectors and interfaces. This book will explore it all, providing a complete reference to adopting the Cloud with AWS.

The book is presented as an exploratory journey, navigating through the diverse AWS ecosystem, while putting the pieces together to implement the four main Cloud models.

After reading this book, the student or professional will be able to participate in Cloud adoption projects, with a solid reference source to be an active participant in the project team.
Key Features 
By reading this book you will learn about the AWS Cloud and its components, and where to use them in a Cloud-related project.
To participate in a Cloud-related project, it is important to know the objectives of the system to be built, as much as to know the functionality, purpose, pros, and cons when using one component versus the other.
The book was written with a technical perspective, including logical design, diagrams, and architecture representations of the AWS components. It is a step-by-step exploration until the reader understands those components and what the alternatives to put them together are.

This geographically distributed network works on the principles of caching, dynamic acceleration, and edge logic computations.

AWS IoT provides the cloud services that connect your IoT devices to other devices and AWS cloud services. AWS IoT provides device software that can help integrate IoT devices into AWS IoT-based solutions. If the existing devices can connect to AWS IoT, AWS IoT can connect them to the cloud services that AWS provides.

AWS Satellite category contains a fully managed service that enables the control of satellite communications, downlink and process satellite data, and scale satellite operations without having to build or manage and own a ground station infrastructure. Satellites are used for a wide variety of use cases, including weather forecasting, surface imaging, communications, and video broadcasts. Ground stations are at the core of global satellite networks, which are facilities that provide communications between the ground and the satellites by using antennas to receive data and control systems to send radio signals to command and control the satellite. Today, operators must either build their own ground stations and antennas, or obtain long-term leases with ground station providers, often in multiple countries to provide enough opportunities to contact the satellites as they orbit the globe. Once all this data is downloaded, servers, storage, and networking are needed near the antennas to process, store, and transport the data from the satellites.

Chapter 6: [Database] [50 pages]
Description: A database is an electronically stored, systematic collection of data. It can contain any type of data, including words, numbers, images, videos, and files. You can use software called a database management system (DBMS) to store, retrieve, and edit data. In computer systems, the word database can also refer to any DBMS, to the database system, or to an application associated with the database.
A cloud database typically runs on a cloud-computing platform. There are two standard deployment models: users can run databases on the cloud independently or purchase access from a cloud database provider. Cloud databases can follow both SQL and NoSQL data models.
AWS Cloud Databases provides a broad selection of purpose-built databases for any enterprise. AWS databases support all database management tasks, such as server provisioning, patching, configuration, and backups. As a result, you can focus on application development while AWS continuously monitors databases and automate scaling.

Application integration on AWS is a suite of services that enable communication between decoupled components within microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. These services provide decoupling for microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications, allowing developers to connect apps, without needing to write custom code to enable interoperability.

Containers are a key component of modern app development. They have become the standard way to organize compute resources and manage the content of application deployments. 
A container is a standardized unit of software development that holds everything that a software application requires to run. This includes relevant code, runtime, system tools, and system libraries. Containers are created from a read-only template that's called an image. Images are typically built from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a plaintext file that specifies all the components that are included in the container. After they're built, these images are stored in a registry such as Amazon ECR where they can be downloaded from.
Containers provide a discrete reproducible compute environment. They also provide a way to simplify packaging and dependency management. From the orchestration of very large multi-cluster estates to web applications - or even and doing a proof of concept on the developer computer - they are a great way to get started and build software to deploy in the cloud.

With the assumption that robots are machines that sense, compute, and act. AWS Robotics provide a robotics development environment for application development, a robotics simulation service to accelerate application testing, and a robotics fleet management service for remote application deployment, update, and management.
